# AIDD 30 Day Challenge

This repository is a collection of my work for the AI-Driven Development 30 Day Challenge. It documents my journey as I explore the capabilities of AI in software development.

## Structure

This repository is organized into a series of task-specific directories:

-   `task1/`
-   `task2/`
-   `task3/`
-   ...and so on.

Each `task` directory contains the following:

-   `README.md`: A detailed description of the task, my process, and the final outcome.
-   `images/`: A directory for any images or screenshots related to the task.
-   `code/`: A directory for any code written for the task.

This structure allows for a clear and organized presentation of each day's work.
