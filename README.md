# AI-Driven Development — 30 Day Challenge

Welcome to my *AI-Driven Development (AIDD) 30 Day Challenge* repository!  
This repo captures my journey as I explore and apply cutting-edge AI techniques and tools in modern software development workflows.

## 🚀 About This Challenge

The 30-Day Challenge is designed to deepen my understanding of AI-powered development concepts, architectures, and tooling.  
Each task builds upon key principles such as AI-driven architecture, specification-driven development, and autonomous agent collaboration.

## 📂 Repository Structure

To keep my work organized and easy to navigate, I have structured the repository as follows:

- **task1/**, **task2/**, **task3/**, ... (and so on)  
  Each folder corresponds to an individual task in the challenge.

Inside each task directory, you will find:

- **README.md**  
  A detailed write-up including the task description, my approach, and reflections.

- **images/**  
  Screenshots, CLI outputs, diagrams, or any visual assets relevant to the task.

- **code/**  
  Any source code, scripts, or configurations created to complete the task.
