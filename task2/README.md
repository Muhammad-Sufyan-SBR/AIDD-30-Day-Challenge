Part A — Theory Questions

1. Nine Pillars Understanding

Q1: Why is using AI Development Agents (like Gemini CLI) for repetitive setup tasks better for your growth as a system architect?

AI Development Agents jaise Gemini CLI repetitive setup tasks automate karte hain, jis se developer ko time milta hai zyada important aur creative tasks pe focus karne ka, jaise system design aur architecture planning. Yeh AI tools complexity ko handle karte hain aur developers ko ek higher level par sochne aur large systems organize karne ka moka dete hain, jis se unka growth system architect banne mein hota hai.

Q2: Explain how the Nine Pillars of AIDD help a developer grow into an M-Shaped Developer.

Nine Pillars ek integrated system provide karte hain jisme Testing (TDD), AI tools (CLI, agents), specifications, aur orchestration shamil hain. In pillars ke zariye developer multiple skills develop karta hai — coding, testing, AI integration, system design — jis se wo sirf ek language ya domain ka expert nahi balki 2-4 complementary domains mein deep knowledge rakhta hai. Is tarah developer M-Shaped ban jata hai jo AI ki madad se knowledge gaps easily bridge karta hai.

2. Vibe Coding vs Specification-Driven Development

Q1: Why does Vibe Coding usually create problems after one week?

Vibe Coding bina planning aur clear specifications ke coding karna hai, jisme developer sirf apne intuition (vibes) par rely karta hai. Is wajah se code poorly structured, difficult to maintain, aur extendable nahi hota. Ek hafte ke baad bugs, inconsistency, aur refactoring ki problems barh jati hain.

Q2: How would Specification-Driven Development prevent those problems?

Specification-Driven Development (SDD) mein pehle clear, executable specifications likhi jati hain jo human intent ko formalize karti hain. Is se development structured hota hai, code maintainable aur scalable banta hai, aur future changes asaani se kiye ja sakte hain. SDD se bugs kam hote hain aur development process efficient hoti hai.

3. Architecture Thinking

Q1: How does architecture-first thinking change the role of a developer in AIDD?

Architecture-first thinking developer ka role code likhne se badhakar system-level design aur decision making mein convert kar deta hai. Developer ab sirf functions nahi likhta balki modular components, data flow, aur AI agents ke collaboration ko design karta hai, jisse development zyada scalable aur maintainable hoti hai.

Q2: Explain why developers must think in layers and systems instead of raw code.

Developers ko layers (Models, IDEs, Agents) aur systems ke perspective se sochna chahiye kyunki AI-driven development complex hoti hai aur har layer alag responsibility handle karti hai. Raw code sochne se problems fix karna mushkil hota hai, lekin system thinking se modularity, reuse, aur automation improve hoti hai. Is se development process efficient aur error-free hoti hai.

Part B — Practical Task (Screenshot Required)

Task:

Using any AI CLI tool, generate a 1-paragraph specification for an email validation function.

Requirements:

Must contain "@"

Must contain a valid domain (e.g., .com, .org)

Should return clear error messages


CLI Prompt (Example):

Generate a clear and detailed 1-paragraph specification for an email validation function. The function must check if the email contains an '@' symbol, verify the domain is valid (such as '.com', '.org'), and return clear, user-friendly error messages if the validation fails.

Sample Output (Specification Generated by CLI):

The email validation function should first check if the input string contains the '@' character. Next, it should verify that the domain part after '@' is valid and ends with a recognized top-level domain such as '.com' or '.org'. If either of these checks fail, the function should return clear and descriptive error messages indicating whether the '@' symbol is missing or the domain is invalid, helping the user correct the input easily.

(Attach your CLI screenshot here showing the prompt and output)

Part C — Multiple Choice Questions

1. What is the main purpose of Spec-Driven Development?
B. Clear requirements before coding begins


2. What is the biggest mindset shift in AI-Driven Development?
B. Thinking in systems and clear instructions


3. Biggest failure of Vibe Coding?
B. Architecture becomes hard to extend


4. Main advantage of using AI CLI agents (like Gemini CLI)?
B. Handle repetitive tasks so dev focuses on design & problem-solving


5. What defines an M-Shaped Developer?
C. Deep skills in multiple related domains

Reflection

This task highlights how rapidly the developer role is evolving in the AI-Native era. Concepts like the Nine Pillars, Specification-Driven Development, and Development Agents are not just tools — they represent a complete shift in how software is planned, built, and maintained.

By practicing architecture-first thinking and learning to collaborate with AI agents, developers can grow from simple code writers into system-level thinkers, eventually becoming M-Shaped professionals who combine multiple deep skills with intelligent tooling.
